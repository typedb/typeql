# TypeQL Language Library for Java

TypeQL Java library is currently deprecated after the release of TypeDB 3.0. 
We are working on introducing new libraries with query builders and ORMs for the new version of the language.

If you need to access the TypeQL 2.x library, see [releases](https://github.com/typedb/typeql/releases).
